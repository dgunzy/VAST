# Welcome to VAST

**Vital Anaesthesia Simulation Training**

VAST brings the benefits of simulation training to a wide range of contexts. The Course is designed to be portable, locally adaptable and affordable. It reinforces essential clinical practices and focuses on non-technical skills relevant for anaesthesia providers and perioperative teams.

Through partnership and capacity building of a local facilitator network, VAST promotes the ability for enduring and sustainable delivery of simulation-based education.

## Our Mission

We are committed to improving anesthesia safety worldwide through innovative, accessible simulation-based training programs that can be adapted to local contexts and resource constraints.
