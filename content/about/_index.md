# About Us

VAST brings the benefits of simulation training to a wide range of contexts. The Course is designed to be portable, locally adaptable and affordable. It reinforces essential clinical practices and focuses on non-technical skills relevant for anaesthesia providers and perioperative teams. Through partnership and capacity building of a local facilitator network, VAST promotes the ability for enduring and sustainable delivery of simulation-based education.

VAST was first piloted in Rwanda, January 2018 with the support and partnership of Dalhousie University, the Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society International Education Foundation (CASIEF), the University of Rwanda and the Rwanda Society of Anaesthesiologists (RSA). Colleagues at the Scottish Centre for Simulation and Clinical Human Factors (SCSCHF) and the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists (WFSA) were instrumental in steering VAST's development.

In 2020 Vital Anaesthesia Simulation Training (VAST) Ltd was registered as a charity with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. A special thanks to Dr Christian Mukwesi for all of his efforts and input to VAST.
